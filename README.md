# C2JavaProgramming
This repository stores all of the code and programs written throughout the C2 Java Programming course.

It is organised into the main Course Text Units. 

To use the code and programs contained in this repository, I recommend two options:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone and open the files in your text editor or IDE of choice.
or
2. Search through the repository and download whichever files you find useful.

This repository will be updated regularly and will serve as a nice hub to look back over Java programs that have been written over the duration of the course.

Please log any issues that you find within the code and they will be tended to asap.
